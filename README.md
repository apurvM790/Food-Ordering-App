# egnite the app
// only react not there is many other packages are need to better the application.

# npm
// npm(not a node packet manager) because it is not written anywhere and it does not have full form.
// it is the repository of package or utilities which u need

# package.json
// package.json is  configuration for npm
// our project dependent on lot of packages whoch are dependencies and npm will manage it as its version and all

// most important package is bundler which bundles all the html,js,and many files together.
// it will bundle all the files and shipped to production
// we are going to use parcel 

# packages
// two types of packages 
// one is dev dependencies => these are used for development
// one is normal dependencies => these can also be used in production 
// so we have to use parcel as a dev dependencies

# parcel
// parcel is a beast, if our app has skeleton then this parcel give it to the muscels.

# package-lock.json
//package-lock.json => it keeps track of record of all the exact version 
// sha512 - tracks record of all the version in local and when it is deployed in production 

# node modules
// node modules => contains all the code fetched from npm
// it is heavy due to transitive dependencies, 
// means we only download parcel but parcel can be dependent on other depndencies and they are on other like that. 
// we are not push node_modules in github because we can regenerate it with the help of package.json and package-lock.json files.
// its good practice to not to push those things which can be gerated. only essential things should be inside github.


// now using [npx parcel index.html] to ignite the app
// it will provide us a server host to run our app


# parcel role-
- Dev Build
- Local Server
- HMR = Hot Module Replacement
- File watching algorithm - written in c++
- caching - faster builds
- image optimization
- minification
- bundling
- compress
- diagnostic
- Error Handling
- Https
- tree shaking - remove unused code for you
- Different dev and production bundles
 

# scripts
- npm run start == npm start
- npm build != npm run build [X]


# React Component
// React Component => everything in react is component
// two types of -
// first - Class based component - OLD way of writing code
// second - Functional based component - NEW way of writing code




# first code using JSX

// React.createElement => object => HTML element(render)
// root.render(heading) so the ReactDOM takes the heading element and render inside the root 


// to overcome this clumsy code of creating elements using Core React.
// JSX (javascript syntax) [not a part of react]
// this is not HTML it is JSX 
// JSX is HTML-like or XML-like syntax


// JSX=> (Babel) => React.createElement => ReactElement-js Object => HTMLElement(render)
// at the end it has a object.
const Heading = <h1 id="heading">Namaste React using JSXðŸ›¸</h1>

// it is not pure javascript and js engine can not understand JSX
console.log(Heading);
// jsxHeading is also an object of h1 element
// JSX (transpiled before it reaches the js engine) => done by parcel or manage to do that -> (with Babel)
// Babel work to transpile the JSX code into react code.
 

// React Component => everything in react is component
// two types of -
// first - Class based component - OLD way of writing code
// second - Functional based component - NEW way of writing code


const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))

root.render(Heading)



# two types of export
- Named export => export const Components // like that
- default export => export default Components [function or variable name;]


=> the only problem in default you can only export one thing from the file.

=> but in named export you can export n number types of things from one file.


# two types of import:
- Named import => import { Component } from "path of file";

- default import => import Component from "path of file";


# React Hooks :
- Normal js utility functions
- Two types of hooks =: 
- useSate() - to create Superpowerfull state variable in react
- useEffect() - 


# these hooks will stick to the ui and when it changes then it will changes the ui automatically.


# when a state variable updates React will reRender the component

# Reconciliation algorithm (React Fiber)




# Monolith Architecture:
- traditional app were developed using this architecture.
- 


# Mircrosirvice Architecture
- Backend
- UI
- Authentication

it follows the single responsibility principle where each and every service has its own job.


# two approach of api calling
1- [Loads]->[API]->[Render]
            500ms(it will be blank for that time)

2- [Loads]->[Render]->[API]->[Render]
            (skeleton)
    this 2nd approach gives a better user experience.

# whenever state variable updates, react triggers a reconciliation cycle(re-renders the component).


# 2 types of Routing in Web Apps :
# -{[Single Page Application]} Client Side Routing - in this we are not making any network calls these components are already are loaded into the app and it replaces the one another. 

# <Link></Link> this will be used for routing to different paths or components.

- Server Side Routing - you make a call to the about us html page and it will come as a response.
# <a></a> this will be used for routing to different whole html page.
